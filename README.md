# Ignoring Function Return Values in Swift

This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: ignoring the return value of a function.  The `bug.swift` file contains a function that calculates a sum, but its return value is not utilized in the main code. The `bugSolution.swift` demonstrates the correct way of handling the return value.

This can lead to unexpected behavior and subtle bugs in your code. Always ensure that functions returning values are used appropriately in your Swift programs.
